    <p><h3>Description:</h3> Pilav, often referred to as pilaf in English, 
        is a traditional dish made from rice. 
        It is prepared by first saut√©ing rice in oil or 
        butter until it becomes slightly golden, 
        then cooking it in a flavorful broth, 
        often with added ingredients like vegetables, 
        meat, or spices. The result is a savory, 
        aromatic rice dish that can be a side or a 
        main course. Pilav is popular in many cuisines 
        around the world, including Middle Eastern, 
        Central Asian, and Mediterranean cultures.</p>
